VASP version:
5.4.4

Functionalities: 
1. Controlling the supercell relaxations in various ways.
2. Switching the "Selective Dynamics" to work on C, instead of D.

Examples: 
# Calculate the stable SF and the gamma line using the tilted-cell method:
B Yin, Z Wu, WA Curtin, Acta Materialia 123, 223-234, 2017

# Calculate the gamma line under applied stress using the tilted-cell method:
P Andric, B Yin, WA Curtin, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 122, 262-279, 2019



One extra input file is needed, Y_CONSTR_LATT. An example is given.

The format of the input file, 
modeid (stress component(s) to be relaxed)
target pressure: tp(i),i=1,6
The order is the same as that in OUTCAR,  XX   YY   ZZ   XY   YZ   ZX, which is pressure, -stress, in kB.
 
modeid=3: relax sigma_33
     356: relax sigma_3j by tilting a3
     123: relax sigma_ii
    else: default mode
